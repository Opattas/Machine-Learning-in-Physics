# Machine Learning in Physics â€” Predicting Orbital Dynamics

This project explores the application of machine learning to classical mechanics. 
Neural networks were trained to predict the motion of a spacecraft orbiting one or more massive bodies under gravity. 
Dense regression and LSTM architectures were implemented and evaluated on simulated datasets generated with the Euler method. 
Results show that LSTMs, by capturing temporal dependencies, can reproduce orbital trajectories more accurately over long prediction horizons.
